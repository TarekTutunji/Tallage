// The public projector board.
//
// The board is the screen at the front of the room. Everybody sees it at once,
// including players whose own screens are only allowed a small part of the
// truth, so everything on it has to be something the room is already entitled
// to know. Three tiers decide that, and every event in the game belongs to
// exactly one of them:
//
//   - Public. Things that happen in the open: battles, conquests, revolts,
//     monarchs losing their thrones, merchants fleeing, war declarations,
//     damage taken. These go on the board as soon as the phase is resolved.
//     Nothing leaks by their absence either, because whether they happened is
//     public in the room anyway.
//
//   - Sealed until the next war. Army sizes and a country's own money: how
//     much a country built, what its peasants paid. The war phase publishes
//     every army (see engine.GameState.PublishArmies), so a finished war is
//     the moment these numbers stop being secret. Until then the board says
//     nothing about them at all - not even that a country spent nothing,
//     which would be a tell in itself.
//
//   - Secret to the end. Merchant gold: purses, hidden gold, investments,
//     merchant taxes, payouts, shares of a treasury. Nothing in the rules ever
//     reveals these mid-game, so the board never shows them. They come out on
//     the end-game screen.
//
// What the board shows live, then, is each realm's public standing (health,
// ruler, government, the army as of the last war, which merchants are where)
// plus the beats of the phase that just finished. Rounds unsealed by a
// finished war are also kept, with their real numbers, as a chronicle.
